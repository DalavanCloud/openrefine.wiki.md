_List of sample datasets that you can use to try out OpenRefine._

Here are a few sample data sets to get you started on understanding how to use OpenRefine

- [https:_aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/_](AWS+Public+Datasets+at+Amazon) 
- [http:_labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/_](Million+Song+Dataset)
- [http:_www.lseg.com/markets-products-and-services/post-trade-services/unavista/unavista-solutions/emir-trade-repository/trade-repository-public-data_](TRADE+REPOSITORY+PUBLIC+DATA)
- [http:_electionstatistics.sos.la.gov/Data/Elected\_Officials/ElectedOfficials.xls_](Louisiana+elected+officials) - For OpenRefine versions up to 2.0, you must use Excel itself to convert the .xls file to a .tsv file first because the Java library for dealing with .xls files doesn't like this particular .xls file. OpenRefine versions 2.1 and above will successfully load the .xls directly
