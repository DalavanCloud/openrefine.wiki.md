_Screencasts about Refine_

These three screencasts give a great overview of the product in just a few minutes. Highly recommended!

- [http:_www.youtube.com/watch?v=B70J\_H\_zAWM_](Introduction) (6:48)
- [http:_www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO8NVCs\_Ba0_](Data+Transformation) (8:33)
- [http:_www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsyz3ibYzk_](Data+Augmentation) (6:10)

_NOTE: These were done by Google when the product was named Google Refine, but they still provide a great introduction and not much has changed except the name._
